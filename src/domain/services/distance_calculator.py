            A domain service that encapsulates calculations related to camera surveillance.
            It provides methods to compute the maximum distance at which a camera can capture an
            optimal image based on the DORI standard and field-of-view (FoV) considerations.

    DORI standard (Detection, Observation, Recognition, Identification) and the Focal Length & Field of View (FoV) equation.
    Determines the maximum distance between the camera lens and the target within which the camera captures an optimal image
    for a given surveillance purpose.
